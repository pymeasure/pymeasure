# Release

## PyMeasure package

1. Pull the latest `master` branch
2. `git checkout -b v<version>_release`
3. Update CHANGES.rst with the changelog
    * On the repo page, go to Tags->Releases->Draft a new release
    * Add a dummy tag name and select "create tag on publish" -- we will not execute this, just use it to autogenerate a changelog
    * The button "Generate release notes" will generate Markdown text with all PRs since the last tag -- copy that into CHANGES.rst
    * Adapt the format and structure to the previous release message:
    * Divide the entries into categories and try to begin entries with "New", "Add", "Fix" or "Remove" as appropriate. (This could also be automated by the above generator with some labeling effort on our part)
    * We also remove the PR URLs as they clutter the log and condense the new contributors list.
4. Push the changes up as a PR
5. Verify that the builds complete
6. Merge the PR
7. Fetch `master`, build and check the source packages
    - `python -m pip install --upgrade build twine`
    - `python -m build`
    - Check the distributions (`twine check dist/*`, version will not yet be correct)
8. Create a git tag in the format "vX.Y.Z"
9. Build final packages and confirm the correct version number is being used
    - `python -m build`
    - Check the distributions (`twine check dist/*`)
10. Push the Git tag
11. Create a tagged [release on GitHub](https://github.com/pymeasure/pymeasure/releases). You'll have to paste in the changelog entry and probably edit it a bit as that form expects Markdown, not ReST.

## PyPI release

Official guide [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

1. Upload the wheel and source distributions to the test server
    - `python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
2. Verify the test repository: https://test.pypi.org/project/PyMeasure
3. Confirm that the installation works (best in a separate environment)
    - `python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps pymeasure`
4. Upload to the real repository (`twine upload dist/PyMeasure-<version>*`)
5. Verify that the package is updated: https://pypi.org/project/PyMeasure

## conda-forge feedstock

1. Release to PyPI first (the feedstock pulls from there)
2. Pull the latest `master` branch
3. `git checkout -b v<version>_release`
4. Get the SHA256 hash of the PyPI package at https://pypi.org/project/PyMeasure/#files
5. Update recipe/meta.yml with the checksum and version number
6. Push the changes up as a PR
7. Verify that the builds complete
8. Merge the PR
