# After completing expected_protocol tests, add tests elsewhere:
# TODO: Add protocol tests for a simple instrument
# TODO: Add protocol tests for an instrument with multiple channels
# TODO: Add protocol tests for a frame-based instrument (recommend: TC038, TC038D)
# TODO: (Later) Add protocol tests for an instrument with a custom Adapter, refactor that (probably)
# TODO: (Later) Search for any custom Adapters and refactor those
