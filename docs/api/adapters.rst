pymeasure.adapters
##################

The adapter classes allow the instruments to be independent of the communication method used.
The instrument implementation takes care of any potential quirks in its commmunication protocol (see :ref:`advanced_communication_protocols`), and the adapter takes care of the details of the over-the-wire communication with the hardware device.
In the vast majority of cases, it will be sufficient to pass a connection string or integer to the instrument (see :ref:`connecting-to-an-instrument`), which uses the :class:`pymeasure.adapters.VISAAdapter` in the background.
