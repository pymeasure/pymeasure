Introduction
============

The :code:`pymeasure` package uses an object oriented approach for communicating with instruments, which provides a more intuitive interface through the encapsulation of low level SCPI commands. That way you can focus on solving the measurement problems at hand, instead of re-inventing how to communicate with them. 

Instruments with VISA (GPIB, Serial, etc) are supported through the `PyVISA package`_ under the hood. `Prologix GPIB`_ adapters are also supported.

Before using PyMeasure, you should be acquainted with `basic Python programming for the sciences`_ and understand the concept of objects.
