Instrument ready
================

In the :code:`pymeasure` package you will find a number of instruments already defined. Their definitions are organized based on the manufacturer name of the instrument. For example the class that defines the Keithley 2400 SourceMeter can be imported by calling:

.. code-block:: python

  from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2400
