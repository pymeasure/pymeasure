    Given an instrument class and a list of command-response pairs, this
    context manager confirms that the code in the context manager block
    produces the expected messages.

    Terminators are excluded from the protocol definition, as those are
    typically a detail of the communication method (i.e. Adapter), and not the
    protocol itself.

        List of command-response pairs, i.e. 2-tuples like `('VOLT?', '3.14')`.
        'None' indicates that a pair member (command or response) does not
        exist, e.g. `(None, 'RESP1')`. Commands and responses are without
        termination characters.
