    """ Adapter class for the VISA library, using PyVISA to communicate with instruments.

    The workhorse of our library, used by most instruments.

    :param resource_name: A
        `VISA resource string <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/names.html>`__
        or GPIB address integer that identifies the target of the connection
    :param visa_library: PyVISA VisaLibrary Instance, path of the VISA library or VisaLibrary spec
        string (``@py`` or ``@ivi``). If not given, the default for the platform will be used.
    :param log: Parent logger of the 'Adapter' logger.
    :param \\**kwargs: Keyword arguments for configuring the PyVISA connection.

    :Kwargs:
        Keyword arguments are used to configure the connection created by PyVISA. This is
        complicated by the fact that *which* arguments are valid depends on the interface (e.g.
        serial, GPIB, TCPI/IP, USB) determined by the current ``resource_name``.

        A flexible process is used to easily define reasonable *default values* for
        different instrument interfaces, but also enable the instrument user to *override any
        setting* if their situation demands it.

        A kwarg that names a pyVISA interface type (most commonly ``asrl``, ``gpib``, ``tcpip``, or
        ``usb``) is a dictionary with keyword arguments defining defaults specific to that
        interface. Example: ``asrl={'baud_rate': 4200}``.

        All other kwargs are either generally valid (e.g. ``timeout=500``) or override any default
        settings from the interface-specific entries above. For example, passing
        ``baud_rate=115200`` when connecting via a resource name ``ASRL1`` would override a
        default of 4200 defined as above.

        See :ref:`connection_settings` for how to tweak settings when *connecting* to an instrument.
        See :ref:`default_connection_settings` for how to best define default settings when
        *implementing an instrument*.
