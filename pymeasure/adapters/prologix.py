class PrologixAdapter(SerialAdapter):
    """ Encapsulates the additional commands necessary
    to communicate over a Prologix GPIB-USB Adapter,
    using the SerialAdapter.

    Each PrologixAdapter is constructed based on a serial port or
    connection and the GPIB address to be communicated to.
    Serial connection sharing is achieved by using the :meth:`.gpib`
    method to spawn new PrologixAdapters for different GPIB addresses.

    :param port: The Serial port name or a serial.Serial object
    :param address: Integer GPIB address of the desired instrument
    :param rw_delay: An optional delay to set between a write and read call for slow to respond instruments.
    :param preprocess_reply: optional callable used to preprocess strings
        received from the instrument. The callable returns the processed string.
    :param kwargs: Key-word arguments if constructing a new serial object

    :ivar address: Integer GPIB address of the desired instrument

    To allow user access to the Prologix adapter in Linux, create the file:
    :code:`/etc/udev/rules.d/51-prologix.rules`, with contents:

    .. code-block:: bash

        SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001",MODE="0666"

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
