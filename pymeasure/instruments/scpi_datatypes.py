    """Represents a SCPI keyword with shortform handling.

    A `SCPIKeyword` is a string subclass that enforces SCPI keyword syntax and automatically derives
    the valid shortform abbreviation (the uppercase portion, plus any digits). It can be compared
    case-insensitively against either its longform or shortform.

    Example:
        >>> k = SCPIKeyword("PYMeasure")
        >>> k.shortform
        'PYM'
        >>> k == "PYM"
        True
        >>> k == "PyMeasure"
        True
        >>> k == "PyMeas"
        False

    Rules:
        * Must contain only alphanumeric characters.
        * Uppercase letters define the shortform abbreviation.
        * Must start with at least one uppercase letter to define the shortform.
        * Must follow the pattern <uppercase><lowercase><digits>.
