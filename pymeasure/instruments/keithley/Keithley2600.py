    """Represents the Keithley 2600 Series SourceMeters and provides a
    high-level interface for interacting with the instrument.

    The Keithley 2600 series operates with lua-like commands in Keithley's proprietory Test Script Program (TSP) language
    and does not support SCPI beyond basic commands (*IDN? and so on).

    Commands are sent directly to the instrument via self.write_command(). __start_on_call decides whether the received
    commands are executed immediately or after calling execute_script().
    All (pymeasure) functions that wait for a command should always be executed with __start_on_call = True, or else
    they will time-out.

    Keithley 2600 Instruments come with some factory (TSP) scripts already loaded on the instrument.
    External TSP scripts (written in Lua) can be loaded onto the instrument via load_TSP(filename).
