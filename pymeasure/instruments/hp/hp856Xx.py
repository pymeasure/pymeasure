        The FFT command performs a discrete Fourier transform on the source
        trace array and stores the logarithms of the magnitudes of the results
        in the destination array. The maximum length of any of the traces is
        601 points. FFT is designed to be used in transforming zero-span
        amplitude-modulation information into the frequency domain. Performing
        an FFT on a frequency sweep will not provide time-domain results. The
        FFT results are displayed on the spectrum analyzer in a logarithmic
        amplitude scale. For the horizontal dimension, the frequency at the
        left side of the graph is 0 Hz, and at the right side is Finax- Fmax is
        equal to 300 divided by sweep time. As an example, if the sweep time of
        the analyzer is 60 ms, Fmax equals 5 kHz. The FFT algorithm assumes
        that the sampled signal is periodic with an integral number of periods
        within the time-record length (that is, the sweep time of the
        analyzer). Given this assumption, the transform computed is that of a
        time waveform of infinite duration, formed of concatenated time
        records. In actual measurements, the number of periods of the sampled
        signal within the time record may not be integral. In this case, there
        is a step discontinuity at the intersections of the concatenated time
        records in the assumed time waveform of infinite duration. This step
        discontinuity causes measurement errors, both amplitude uncertainty
        (where the signal level appears to vary with small changes in
        frequency) and frequency resolution (due to filter shape factor and
        sidelobes). Windows are weighting functions that are applied to the
        input data to force the ends of that data smoothly to zero, thus
        reducing the step discontinuity and reducing measuremen errors.

        'conversion_loss' specifies the mean conversion loss for the current harmonic band.
        In a full frequency band (such as band K), the mean conversion loss is defined as the
        minimum loss plus the maximum loss for that band divided by two.
        Adjusting for conversion loss allows the system to remain

        querying 'conversion_loss' returns a zero.
