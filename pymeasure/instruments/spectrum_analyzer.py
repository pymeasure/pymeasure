class SpectrumAnalyzer(Instrument):
    """Represents a generic SCPI Spectrum Analyzer and provides a high-level interface for controlling basic instrument parameters and capturing traces.

    The key features of the generic instrument implementation are as follow:
    - interface is intentionally simple to be easily adapted to wide range of spectrum analyzers.
    - all the functions that could efficiently implemented in python are not implemented (e.g. peak search, mathematical operations on the traces,
    unit translation, etc.), this can be referred as pure software implementation of part of the instrument.
    - all the features which are relevant for interactive use of the instrument are not implemented (e.g. markers, display control, multiple traces, etc.)
    - a default implementation using commands based on SCPI specification 1999 is provided, but all properties are declared dynamic so subclasses
    can easily modify them.

    The default implementation could be good to address also spectrum analyzers not yet implemented, since the default SCPI commands are quite common with
    major vendors.

    This class is normally subclassed to implement specific instruments.

Example of initialization
