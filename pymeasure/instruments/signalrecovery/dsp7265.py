        The provided data is converted as much as possible, but there are some requirements to the

        converted it will be omitted in the returned data or an exception will be raised,
        depending on the value of raise_error.

        The requirements for converting the data are as follows:

        - Converting X, Y, magnitude and noise requires sensitivity data, which can either be part
          of the provided data or can be provided via the sensitivity argument
        - The same holds for X2, Y2 and magnitude2 with sensitivity2.
        - Converting the frequency requires both 'frequency part 1' and 'frequency part 2'.

        :param dict buffer_data:
            The data to be converted. Must be in the format as returned by the
            `get_buffer` method: a dict of numpy arrays.

        :param sensitivity:
            If provided, the sensitivity used to convert X, Y, magnitude and noise.
            Can be provided as a float or as an array that matches the length of elements in
            `buffer_data`. If both a sensitivity is provided and present in the buffer_data, the
            provided value is used for the conversion, but the sensitivity in the buffer_data is
            stored in the returned dict.

        :param sensitivity2:
            Same as the first sensitivity argument, but for X2, Y2, magnitude2 and noise2.

        :param bool raise_error:
            Determines whether an exception is raised in case not all keys provided in buffer_data
            can be converted. If False, the columns that cannot be converted are omitted in the
            returned dict.
