(93) MAR ~; NENT The MAR ~; NENT command sets the search measurement sense channel source, target
measurement,
and compliance values, and the search channel start/stop and compliance values.
It also sets the output state after stopping for both the sense channel and search channel.
(94) MAR~；CMD~；NEN During search measurement, you can set ON/OFF of the measurement data comparison
calculation and the upper and lower limit data to be compared.

Syntax:
MAR 0, search mode, generated value after stop; command; NEN

1 Binary search measurement: sense channel
2 Binary search measurement: search channel (negative feedback search)
3 Binary search measurement: search channel (positive feedback search)
4 Linear search measurement: sense channel
5 Linear search measurement: search channel

Occurrence value after stopping
1 Generates a bias value.
2 Leave the finished generation value as is.
3 Generate stop values.

- The commands that can be used for search measurement are shown below.

                Binary search                 Linear search
sense channel:  FXI, FXV, PXI, PXV, CMD       FXI, FXV, PXI, PXV, CMD
search channel: WI, WV                        WI, WV, PWI, PWV, CMD

- If you set a command other than the above with the MAR ~; NENT command, an error will occur.
- The linear search CMD (comparison operation) command is set to either the sense channel or the
search channel.
  Therefore, if the CMD command is set for both channels, the comparison operation is performed with
the one that was set later.

Number of steps: 2. When the source range is 600mV, search is performed in steps of 20µV.

(97) PGON To execute a high-speed sequence program, store the program in program numbers 1 to 20
with the PGST ; END command in advance.
Note that program numbers that do not store programs are skipped without being executed.
(98) PGOF This command cancels the start/enable state of the high-speed sequence program set by the
